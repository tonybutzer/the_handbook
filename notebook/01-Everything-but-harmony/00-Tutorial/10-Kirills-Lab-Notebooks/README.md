# Presentation on IPython notebook

This repository contains slides and sample notebooks for IPython
notebook talk I did on 13-Aug-2015 at
[Canberra Python Users Group](https://wiki.python.org/moin/CanberraPUG)
meetup.

You can view presentation here: [Slides](http://rawgit.com/Kirill888/presentation-ipython-notebook/master/slides.html)

Slides themselves were written in IPython and converted to HTML presentation using IPython built-in tool nbconvert. See [this blog](http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/make-your-slides-with-ipython.html) for details on how this feature of IPython can be used.
