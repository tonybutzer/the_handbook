# ESIP Sponsored

## Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) 

is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, volunteer and community-driven organization that advances the use of Earth science data through meetings and virtual collaborations around 30+ Earth science data related topics.

Created by NASA in 1998, ESIP was formed in response to a National Research Council recommendation calling for the involvement of community stakeholders in the development of NASAâ€™s Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) as a critical element of the U.S. Global Change Research Program.

## Funded by NASA and USGS

### Mission
To support the networking and data dissemination needs of our members and the global Earth science data community by linking the functional sectors of observation, research, application, education and use of Earth science.

### Vision
To be a leader in promoting the collection, stewardship and use of Earth science data, information and knowledge that is responsive to societal needs.
