These vary depending on how the data are stored, where they are located, etc. To help keep things as simple as possible, the 'pandas' Python library provides an operator, `read_csv()` that allows you to access data \ufb01les in tabular format on your computer as well as data stored in online repositories, or one that a course instructor might set up for his or her students.\n",
